title: The Hows Of Mastodon
---

Twitter is in meltdown.  Since Musk's takover Lots of disenfrancised tweeps are looking to abscond to more stable climes.  To my tech-savvy but not social-media-savvy mind,  this exodus seems to be driven by three factors: 

1. Musk as an individual is a divisive character. People were leaving at the mere rumour of his buy-out.
1. Lay-offs in the security, site reliability, and ethics teams (to name a few) leave the site worse-off technically.  The site might just keel-over now, and is a easier target for hackers
1. The new paid-for approach to the "blue tick" verification system undermines the entire point of it.  It's far too easy to pretend to be someone important now.

While there's not been a clear cut alternative, Mastdon has emerged as the potential replacement, even garnering the interest of [bbc news](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-63534240).
